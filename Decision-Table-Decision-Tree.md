# Decision Table | Decision Tree *

Why might you use a decision tree rather than a decision table?

**Decision Table** is just a tabular representation of all conditions and actions. Decision tables will not return if the first condition is met. It will evaluate all conditions before returning a result.

 **Decision Trees** are always used whenever the processing logic is very complicated and involves multiple conditions.

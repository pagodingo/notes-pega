# Conditional Visibility

What you'll need ... 

- A property to hide
- A property to toggle your property to hide
- An action set upon your toggle property (**Event:** "Change"; **Action:** "Display: Refresh")

The act of configuring conditional visibility I feel is self explanatory (much of it is handled in the section rule), conceptualizing the different pieces required can sometimes be tricky. So I hope the quick blurb above is a help reminder.

# Report Definition *

        What is a Report Definition Rule?

 Report Definitions are used to fetch data. Report Definitions can be used to retrieve data from rule-based tables in Pega, or external sources. Report Definitions also allow for the data fetched to be displayed in the form of a list of records, or a summarized chart.

        What is the maximum number of records a report can retrieve?

500

        Can the max value above be overridden?

Yes

        What is the difference between class joins and sub reports?
        
Class joins join data from two tables together. Sub reports will return data from one report, then, a new report will be generated from the results of the first, typically after some additional filtering.

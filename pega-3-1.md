## Recap: Data Pages and Data Transformation

When to use: Use Data Pages when accessing or persisting data to or from a database.

Data Transformation refers to sending data from one case (or app) to another. It is best to try and use data transformation whenever possible, to avoid duplicating data in another case type when it is already available in another.

## Data Transformation

Similar to Data Propegation, Data Transformation is the act of moving data from one case to another. Data Transformation differs from Data Propegation in the sense that DT allows to you to modify your data as it's moved. Data can also be copied conditionally through the use of Validation rules. Configuring transformations is most easily done through Flow Action rules, which can be found by clicking on the Map Icon located to the right of each Stage Process label.

## Case Status

Each case in Pega (once created) has a status. The  status of a newly created case is simply "new." Other statuses include Resolved-Completed, and Resolved-Canceled to name a few.

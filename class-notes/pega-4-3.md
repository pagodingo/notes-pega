## Dynamic UI design

Dynamic UI design is the practice of <u>designing a user interface to adapt according to user input.</u> When designing a dynamic user interface (UI), you control the fields that users see and interact with, according to specified conditions. Dynamic UI content is a key element of an intent-driven UI design.

> **Choices made by users <u>drive</u> what controls are displayed, so that only relevant fields are presented.**

For example, when submitting a `loan request`, customers specify their `marital status`. If customers select `married`, the application displays user entry fields for their partner.

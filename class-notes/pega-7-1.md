## Report Definitions

- Report definition is a type of rule in Pega that is used to **interact** with database tables. It's used to fetch information from tables configured in your application, and display it either the form of a chart or list of records.

- Report definitions can be found under the **Reports** category in the **Records** explorer. Or, under Reports in your respctive Case Type, if configured at case level.

- Results from a Report Definition can be filtered (by use of conditions: *when* rules).

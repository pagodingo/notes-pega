# <u>Pega 4-2</u>

## Activities  in Pega

An Activity is a Pega Rule that performs a list of actions.

They contain steps, and are very much comparable to algorithms in most general programming languages.

Using activities in Pega can be very useful, but it's not recommended that you use them often. The reason being, activities can require you to **write your own code.**

This can introduce complexities in your app if or when you do not write code that follows standard Pega conventions.

If no other Pega ruletype supports your requirements, then activities can be considered. In all other cases, using Pega's provided ruletypes is <u>highly suggested</u>.

For example, Pega offers Savable Data Pages to store data in applications.

When connecting to databases and saving data externally - you'll have to use activities. Pega provides no other option.

|When to use Activities|When not to use Activities|
|-|-|
|Saving records to database(s) with special requirements. Or when databases are external.|Declare expressions for data calculations.|
|Deleting records from the database.|Report definitions for database query.|
|Background Processes.|Data transform for data manipulations.|
|To use the property-set message or page-set message.| |

## Creating an Activity

Activity columns:

- label
- method
- step page
- description

|Label|Method|Step Page|Description|Jump|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Step name (think of a list of instructions).|Predefined Pega methods (Call, Java, Connect).|A step page is a page in memory on which the method is processed. New pages are added under > Pages & Classes. The beginning class will be the primary page, and the Supporting class will become the secondary.|Method Description| Specificies (conditionally) which step to jump to.|

|Loop|When|
|-|-|
|To loop a step continuously.|To set conditions required to run each ste.p|

> Next to `When`, there is an arrow `>` that displays additional parameters (required & optional) for each method.

Additional Activity configurations (tabs) :

- Parameters
- Pages & Classes
- Security
- etc.

## Example

1. Create Case
2. Create Step (Save student)
3. Create view, define data type (student: student name, id)
4. Create Activity (save student)
5. Activity Step #1
    - Method: Page-new
    - Step Page: Savable Data page (configured in Pages & classes)
    - Description: creating an empty record.
6. Activity Step #2
    - Method: Property-Set
    - Same as Previous (Savable Data Page)
    - Description: Set properties
    Parameters: (Expand arrow right of `when`) > PropertyName: D_Datapage.StudentID, PropertyName: D_Datapage.StudentName, etc.
7. Activity Step #3
    - Method: Obj-Save
    - Step Page: *
    - Desc: Save student data
    - Method parameters:
    WriteNow[x], WithErrors[], OnlyIfNew[]
8. Activity Step #4
    - Method: Commit.
    - Step Page: *

Activities can be called from flow action rules:

Open Flow Action > Post Processing > Run Activity: ___________.

> To resolve first list items not saving: App Explorer > "yourClass" > Data Model > Data Transform > pySetFieldDefaults > **Delete row labeled *"...yourDataType.(1)"**
